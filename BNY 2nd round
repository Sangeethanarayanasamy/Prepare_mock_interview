4️⃣ What is your role in sprint?

Q: What do you do in a sprint?

A:

Functionally validate assigned user stories

Raise and retest defects

Execute regression and sanity

Automate feasible UI/API scenarios

Maintain automation scripts

5️⃣ Tell me about your team.

A:
The QA team consists of 3 members:

I work as a Senior Automation Engineer

Two associate-level members focus primarily on functional testing

6️⃣ Do you work with offshore teams?

Q: Have you worked in onsite-offshore model?

A:
Yes.
In previous projects including PNC Bank, I collaborated with offshore teams in India for:

Data dependency resolution

Cross-code integration

End-to-end validation

📌 Domain Experience
7️⃣ Tell me about UPS domain.

Q: What does UPS application support?

A:
UPS application supports:

Pack & Ship

Store locator

Printing & mailbox services

Notary services

Payment processing

It’s a retail-based system with multiple modules and internal ERP integration.

8️⃣ Tell me about your banking experience.

Q: What was your role in PNC Bank?

A:
I worked on:

Online banking

Consumer & retail banking

Core banking system

Account management (checking, savings, loans)

Transaction management (deposit, transfer, bill payments)

Mortgage systems

9️⃣ How do you test payment functionality?

Q: How do you test credit card payment scenario?

A:

Positive Testing:

Validate successful payment

Check confirmation screen

Verify SMS/email notification

Negative Testing:

Insufficient funds

Transaction timeout

Network interruption

Session timeout

We use mock services for controlled payment simulation.

🔟 How do you simulate network delays?

Q: How do you test latency and timeout?

A:

Use Network Link Conditioner (Mac)

Configure server-side API response delays

Adjust database timeout settings

Validate UI behavior under delayed responses

📌 Core Java & OOP Concepts
1️⃣1️⃣ Explain OOP concepts in automation.

Q: Explain OOP in Selenium framework.

A:

Abstraction:

Using interfaces like:

WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();

Encapsulation:

Using Page Object Model to combine elements and methods.

Inheritance:

Using base class for browser setup and extending in child classes.

Polymorphism:

Method overloading

Method overriding

1️⃣2️⃣ Difference between String, StringBuffer, StringBuilder?

A:

Feature	String	StringBuffer	StringBuilder
Mutable	No	Yes	Yes
Thread Safe	Yes	Yes	No
Performance	Slow	Moderate	Fast

Use:

StringBuilder for single-thread frequent modification

StringBuffer for multi-threaded environment

1️⃣3️⃣ Abstract class vs Interface?

A:

Abstract Class	Interface
Can have abstract & non-abstract methods	Only abstract methods (until Java 8 default methods)
Uses extends	Uses implements
Can have variables with access modifiers	Variables are public static final
Cannot instantiate	Cannot instantiate
1️⃣4️⃣ Explain String comparison output.

Q: What is difference between == and .equals()?

A:

== compares memory reference

.equals() compares values

If string literal → same pool → == true
If created with new → different object → == false

1️⃣5️⃣ How to reverse a string?

A:
Convert string to char array → swap left & right pointers → return new string.

📌 Collections Framework
1️⃣6️⃣ List vs Set vs Map?

A:

Collection	Duplicates	Order Maintained
List	Yes	Yes
Set	No	No
Map	Key-Value	No

LinkedHashSet maintains insertion order.

1️⃣7️⃣ ArrayList vs LinkedList?

A:

ArrayList → Faster for retrieval

LinkedList → Better for insertion & deletion

📌 Exception Handling
1️⃣8️⃣ Checked vs Unchecked Exception?

A:

Checked → Compile time (must handle)

Unchecked → Runtime

1️⃣9️⃣ throw vs throws?

A:

throw → Used inside method

throws → Declared in method signature

📌 Synchronization & Selenium
2️⃣0️⃣ What is Stale Element Exception?

A:
Occurs when DOM changes and element reference becomes invalid.
Fix: Refresh page or re-locate element.

2️⃣1️⃣ findElement vs findElements?

A:

findElement → returns first match / throws exception

findElements → returns list / empty list if not found

2️⃣2️⃣ Explicit Wait vs Fluent Wait?

A:

Explicit Wait:

Wait until specific condition (clickable, visible)

Fluent Wait:

Custom polling interval

Ignore specific exceptions

📌 Cucumber & Framework
2️⃣3️⃣ Explain Cucumber structure.

A:

Structure:

Base class (browser setup)

Pages (POM)

Modules (flow-based grouping)

Feature files

Step definitions

Runner class

Utilities

Data folder (Excel / Properties)

2️⃣4️⃣ Scenario vs Scenario Outline?

A:

Scenario → Single data execution

Scenario Outline → Multiple data sets using Examples table

2️⃣5️⃣ How do you pass data?

A:

Using TestNG DataProvider (Excel/CSV)

Using Scenario Outline Examples

Using JDBC for DB validation

📌 Jenkins Execution
2️⃣6️⃣ How do you execute from Jenkins?

A:

Freestyle project

Pull from Git

Tag-based execution (smoke/sanity/regression)

Scheduled daily run

Controlled from TestNG XML

📌 SQL Question
2️⃣7️⃣ Write SQL query for salary ≥ 6500 in QE department.

A:

SELECT *
FROM employee e
JOIN department d
ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id
WHERE e.salary >= 6500
AND d.department_name = 'QE';
