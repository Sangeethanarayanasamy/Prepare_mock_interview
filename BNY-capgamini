1️⃣ AI Agent / LLM tooling (high-level only)

They were happy with your QA role explanation, but they want you to strengthen vocabulary + flow, not implementation.

👉 Brush up on:

Agentic AI basics

What is an AI agent

Tools + memory + planner (just concepts)

LangChain components

Chains

Agents

Tools

Prompt templates

How LLMs are plugged into apps (not trained)

💡 They do NOT expect you to code LangChain — only explain how it fits in the system.

2️⃣ LLM testing & evaluation terminology

You already know this — they want it more structured and confident.

Brush up keywords:

Golden dataset

Prompt regression

Hallucination testing

Bias testing

Response consistency

Threshold-based validation

Offline vs online evaluation

👉 You already spoke about golden prompts + 90% threshold — that was good. Just tighten it.

3️⃣ Metrics clarity (minor polish)

You mixed a couple of terms (very common, no issue).

Brush up clearly:

Classification: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1

Regression: MSE, RMSE, MAE

LLM eval: Human eval + automated scoring (pass/fail, similarity, thresholds)

They weren’t testing math — just clarity.

4️⃣ Mocking tools naming (small thing)

You explained mocking well, but:

Be consistent with tool name (Mockoon)

Know why mocking is used in microservices

One clean line is enough:

“We use Mockoon to mock external dependencies so testing is isolated and stable.”

1️⃣ Clean & STRONG Introduction (use this verbatim)

**“Hi, I’m Sangeetha. I have around 10 years of experience as a QA Engineer, working across both manual and automation testing. I started with manual testing and gradually moved into full-stack automation.

On the manual side, I’ve worked extensively on API testing using Postman, test case management using ALM, and defect and story tracking using JIRA, following Agile methodologies.

On the automation side, I have strong experience in web, API, and mobile automation. I’ve automated web applications using Selenium WebDriver, Cypress, and Playwright; API automation using Rest Assured with Java; and I’ve also worked on JavaScript-based API automation.

I’ve designed and built automation frameworks using both BDD and TDD approaches, primarily with Cucumber and TestNG.

In my current project at UPS, I work on an AI-driven decision-making system, where I contribute on the QA side by validating web, API, and AI-based workflows using Cypress, Playwright, Selenium, and Rest Assured.”**

This alone already sounds senior-level.

2️⃣ JavaScriptExecutor (clean answer)

If they ask again:

“When normal Selenium click doesn’t work due to overlays or DOM issues, I use JavaScriptExecutor.
I typecast the WebDriver to JavaScriptExecutor and execute JavaScript directly on the element, for example clicking or scrolling into view.
This helps in handling complex UI behaviors that WebDriver alone cannot handle.”..

3️⃣ Window & Frame Handling (clean answer).

“For multiple windows, I use getWindowHandles() to capture all window IDs and switch to the required window using driver.switchTo().window(windowId).

For frames, I switch sequentially — first to the parent frame and then to the child frame using driver.switchTo().frame(). After interacting with elements, I switch back to the default content.”

4️⃣ Stale Element Exception (very good answer – keep this)

“Stale element exception occurs when the DOM refreshes and the previously located element is no longer valid.
To fix this, I re-locate the element after the page refresh instead of using the old reference.”

✔️ This answer is 100% correct.

5️⃣ Explicit vs Implicit Wait (perfect answer, just shorter)

“Implicit wait is a global wait applied to all WebDriver actions.
Explicit wait is more flexible — it allows waiting for a specific condition for a specific element.
I prefer explicit waits because they give better control and reduce unnecessary delays.”

6️⃣ API Chaining (clean & confident)

“API chaining is when the output of one API is used as input for another API.
For example, I first call a login API to get an authentication token, then pass that token to another API to fetch or update resources.
This is commonly used in microservices where APIs are independent but logically connected.”

7️⃣ Mocking (this was GOOD, just refine)

“We use mocking tools like Mockoon to simulate external services.
Mockoon allows us to create mock APIs with predefined responses, either through UI or Docker.
This helps us test our services independently without relying on real external systems.”

8️⃣ AI / LLM Project at UPS (this is your BIG strength)

“At UPS, we work on an AI-driven decision-making system backed by Amazon Bedrock.
The system uses multiple LLMs and an agentic architecture to make decisions based on customer and operational data.

On the QA side, I focus on validating AI workflows, API integrations, data accuracy, and response quality rather than model training.”

9️⃣ LangChain (high-level is PERFECT for QA)

“LangChain is an open-source framework used to build LLM-based applications and agentic workflows.
It allows integration with different LLMs like OpenAI, Gemini, and LLaMA through a common SDK.
I have a high-level understanding of how it’s used in agent-based systems, mainly from a QA and validation perspective.”

⚠️ Do NOT go deeper unless asked. This is exactly right for QA.

🔟 AI Model Validation Metrics (this was excellent)

“The metrics depend on the model type.
For classification models, we look at accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
For regression models, we evaluate metrics like ROC, Mean Squared Error, and error rates.”

1️⃣1️⃣ LLM Evaluation (this answer impressed them)

“We evaluate LLMs using golden datasets and predefined prompts.
We compare the model’s responses against expected outputs and measure accuracy using threshold-based validation.
In our project, we maintain a 90% accuracy threshold before promoting a model to production.”

🔥 This is very strong.

1️⃣2️⃣ Coding Confidence (IMPROVE THIS LINE)

Instead of “7 out of 10”, say:

“I’m very comfortable writing automation scripts in Java and JavaScript, and I continuously improve my coding skills as frameworks and tools evolve.”

Much better 💯...
