1️⃣ What is your current mobile automation setup?

Q: What is your current automation setup?

A:
Currently, we are using Appium 1.22 with Java client (Java 8) integrated with TestNG.
We execute tests on real Android devices and Android emulators, and the execution is managed through Selenium Grid for distributed runs.

2️⃣ How many test cases did you automate in UPS mobile project?

Q: What was your automation coverage in UPS mobile project?

A:
In the UPS mobile project, we automated around 180–200 end-to-end test cases.
The coverage included:

Login flow

Shipment tracking

Push notifications

Payment flow

Profile update

Negative scenarios

Out of these, around 150 test cases were part of regression suite.

3️⃣ How do you execute your regression suite?

Q: How do you execute your test cases locally and in CI?

A:

🔹 Locally:

Test cases are grouped under regression.xml (TestNG suite file)

Executed using Maven command:

mvn clean test


Pass the regression XML file for execution.

🔹 In Jenkins:

Jenkins pulls code from Git

Builds using Maven

Starts the Appium server automatically

Connects to real devices or emulators

Executes suite in parallel based on device configuration

Generates Extent Reports

Jenkins displays pass/fail summary

4️⃣ Which ports are used in iOS automation?

Q: What ports are used in iOS Appium automation?

A:

By default, Appium runs on port 4723

Internally, for iOS automation, WebDriverAgent runs on port 8100 on the device or simulator.

5️⃣ How do you identify mobile elements?

Q: How do you locate elements in mobile automation?

A:
We use Appium Inspector:

Connect real device or emulator

Start Appium server

Launch app

Start session with desired capabilities

Inspect elements

We capture properties like:

Resource ID

Accessibility ID

Content description

Class name

XPath (if necessary)

6️⃣ Have you executed tests on multiple devices in parallel?

Q: How do you handle parallel execution?

A:
Yes, in UPS project we executed:

2 Android devices

1 iOS simulator

We configured:

Unique device names

Unique systemPort values (e.g., 8200, 8201) to avoid conflicts

Parameterized device config in testng.xml

Enabled parallel execution in TestNG

7️⃣ What major issue did you face in UPS mobile project?

Q: What was a major challenge and how did you fix it?

A:
We faced session disconnection during long regression runs.

After ~40–50 test cases:

Appium session terminated

Remaining tests failed

Root Cause:

Device going to idle state

ADB losing connection

Fix:

Used ADB command:

adb shell svc power stayon true


Increased newCommandTimeout

Replaced hard waits with optimized wait handling

8️⃣ How did you get the app builds?

Q: Did you download the app from Play Store/App Store?

A:
No. The dev team generated internal builds from CI pipeline.

🔹 Android:

Signed APK shared via Artifactory or SharePoint

Installed using adb install

🔹 iOS:

.ipa file shared via internal distribution portal

Installed via Xcode with provisioning profile

9️⃣ How do you install apps manually?

Q: How do you install APK/IPA files?

A:

🔹 Android:
adb devices
adb install app.apk
adb install -r app.apk  (replace existing build)

🔹 iOS Simulator:
xcrun simctl install booted app.app

🔹 Real iOS Device:

Installed using Xcode

Or using iDevice installer (if configured)

🔟 How do you manage different environments?

Q: How do you switch between Dev, QA, and UAT?

A:
The base URL is not hardcoded.

The app uses environment-specific config files:

dev_config.json

qa_config.json

We install the build generated for that environment.

For specific API validations, we use Charles Proxy to:

Rewrite endpoints

Redirect traffic

Modify headers

Simulate error responses

1️⃣1️⃣ Which proxy tool do you use?

Q: What proxy tools have you used?

A:
We use Charles Proxy primarily.

Steps:

Configure device proxy settings

Route traffic through Charles

Monitor request/response

Rewrite APIs

Simulate negative scenarios

1️⃣2️⃣ What iOS version did you work on?

Q: Which iOS version did you automate?

A:
We worked on iOS 14.2 for automation.

1️⃣3️⃣ What would you ask at the end of interview?

Q: Do you have any questions for us?

A:
Yes, I would like to understand:

What will be the next round?

Will it be technical or managerial?

Is there any hands-on or client interaction round?
